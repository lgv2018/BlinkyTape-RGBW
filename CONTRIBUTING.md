# Contributors Welcome

I'll fill this out more completely later with steps on how to fork, branch, do pull requests, etc.

For now I wanted to say, I definitely want and welcome input and contributions. Feel free to [open 
an issue](https://github.com/oddacon/BlinkyTape-RGBW/issues) if you have a question, an enhancement request, or a bug report.
